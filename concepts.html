<h1>Concepts</h1>
	<h3> This first image is my most recent concept and is from a certain scene where Darcy is with her sword. She was on a "mission" to find the three cult leaders, and followers of her uncle Zephyr. These leaders were all Zephyr's fellow hunters reincarnated. One of them being reincarnated into a leader who owns a night club. I guess you can tell what happened to the leader. For Darcy's character I took a lot of inspiration for her backstory from Michael Afton from FNAF, Sunny/OMORI from OMORI, Shoya from a Silent voice and Link from TLOZ. Her personality and style inspiration is from Maddi Perez from Euphoria and Marceline from Adventure Time.</h3>

	<h3>This scene represents the fight of the famous hunter Zayn and Queen Athena of the mythical hidden lands on Phillip Island, Victoria. The hideout was close to a treehouse and near the waters of the islands. their deaths ended the war. </h3>

	<h3> Being a psychological-fantasy horror, blood does come in to play quite a bit. This is a concept sketch I made before the artwork of the enemies. Queen Athena's design is inspired by Queen Sonia from The legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</h3>

	<h3>This is one of the cult leaders Tate. She is the manipulative nightclub owner and reincarnation of one of Zephyr's hunters Nathan. She is inspired by Eva from the series SWARM (Played by Billie Eilish) and Jocelyn from the series The Idol (played by Lily-Rose Depp)</h3>

	<h3>As you can tell, these two don't get along. When Darcy is sent to a corretional facility, she meets one of her old enemies Charlotte. This concept was used to draw a concept of Charlotte as well.</h3>
